                <p>Hi, I'm Erik Nuber. Born and raised in sunny California, I have been the Art Director for several magazines over the past eighteen years. I attended U.C. Irvine and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information and Computer Sciences. Basically, a very fancy title for computer programming. </p>
    
                <p>Along with finishing my Bachelors degree, I also went back to school and studied Computer Animation. I absolutely loved every moment of it and, never had so much fun basically playing while learning. However, the biggest draw back to this was the fact it was more than obvious I couldn't draw. I also did self study that landed me in my current profession. I taught myself how to use QuarkXpress, InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. I also attended Mastering Photoshop courses provided directly by Adobe which was a great experience.</p>
                
                <p>I have been moving back towards computer programming as I have a fairly natural gift for picking things up, understanding, and then putting to use what I have learned. Having had a formal education in the field of programming has made things easier because the terms and concepts are already familiar. I have spent months studying using Team Treehouse and Lynda.com both of which have been very useful. Though they do give the broader strokes, I have also spent a lot of time reading and researching online as not everything is well covered or covered at all.</p>
                    
                <p>This website was designed by me with my having written all the code but for the large carousel found on the Article Layouts Page. For that I used Slick carousels and, from there customized it. However, the smaller version found on the same page when the browser size is reduced, I coded myself. One of the things that has been engrained in studying front end design work is using a mobile first approach and creating a responsive layout. So, if you haven't taken the time to adjust your browser, by doing so you will see that the layout changes where it made the most sense to me. </p>
                                
                <p>As for some of the rest, when not sitting at my computer working, I love to travel with my wife, read, play games, collect and, spend time with friends. I have been lucky enough to travel all over the USA. However, I would go back and spend more time in Italy or explore Spain, France and England. </p>
                
                <p>Given the choice of almost any activity, I would choose to play a game. I will play pretty much any type of game be it board, card, puzzle, or video game. I enjoy the social aspect as well as the thought that goes in to playing. I am more a fan of those games that make you think rather than rely on luck but, getting a group of people together to play is always a great way to spend an evening.</p>
                
<!--                <p>I went back to school and studied computer animation for half a year. I absolutely loved every minute of it and, never had so much fun basically playing while learning. However, the biggest draw back to this was the fact it was more than obvious I couldn't draw. Give me a stick figure or a sun with a smilely face and I'm all set. So, I ventured next into the foray of graphic design as it was a field that meshed my interest in computers with the ability to still be creative. I began to study and learn the nuances of QuarkXpress, PhotoShop and Illustrator; later moving on to InDesign in the Adobe Suite.</p>-->
                    
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #751935">Please Note:</p><p>The site isn't just a portfolio for graphic design but, meant also to showcase my ability to code; you will find various methods used throughout that may not necessarily make sense on your everyday website. So while exploring mouse over and click your way through to see various techniques.      </p>
